\chapter{MYSECTION}

This is my text with an example Figure~\ref{fig:example} and example
citation~\cite{Voit2011} or \textcite{Voit2009}. And there is another
citation which is located at the bottom\footcite{tagstore}.

\myfig{TU_Graz_Logo}%% filename in figures folder
      {width=0.1\textwidth,height=0.1\textheight}%% maximum width/height, aspect ratio will be kept
      {Example figure.}%% caption
      {fig:example}%% label

I am sure that you are now able to write your own
document. Always keep in mind: it's the \emph{content} that
matters, not the form. But good typography is able to deliver
the content much better than information set with bad
typography.
